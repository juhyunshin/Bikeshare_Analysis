### Exploring Bike Share Data
1) NY, CHI, DC: What time of day are bikes most frequently returned?

*Findings:* **In NY**, subscriber peak hours are at the common start and end times of a work customers, the category where tourists would fall, tend to check in bikes throughout the day starting late morning. **In Chi**, similar to NY, subscriber peak hours at the typical start/end times of work day more customers tend to use Bike as form of transit in Chicago than in NY, with a clear peak in the 4PM hour. Whereas NY customer check in times were fairly stable throughout period of day that sees acitivity, 11AM - 7PM. **In Wash**, unlike NY & Chi, Wash has a disproportionate number of check-in times at the start of work day, as opposed to be more even between start and end of work day. There is a high frequency of customers consistently checking bikes in at very early times of the day, starting at around 2AM. Itâ€™s possible that there may be more regular customers than in the other two cities or possibly that there are errors in the system, since we would not expect so much activity so early in the day.

2) NY, CHI: Are return times different by age group?

3) NY, CHI: Do rental durations differ by age?
